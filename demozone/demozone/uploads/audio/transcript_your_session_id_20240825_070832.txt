 When you look into a dog's eyes, and you love that dog, and that dog loves you, we both get dopamine.
Sorry, not dopamine, fucking oxytocin.
The human experiences oxytocin, but so does the dog.
Makes sense.
My dog loves to cover his mouth.
 Yeah, yeah, of course.
It makes perfect sense.
But they actually did the science on that, which is pretty cool, I think.
You know the person that did the science?
Hold on a second.
I think there's someone at my door.
Keep talking.
It's recording.
It must be fun.
Like the person that did that study?
 So I've been like, yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That seems like a good kind of science to get into, for sure.
Like a pretty funny kind of science, yeah.
